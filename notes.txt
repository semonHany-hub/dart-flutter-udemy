                                   basics
- lambda expression in functions represt the arrow function (named or anonymous) used mostly with callback functions.
- higher-order-function is a function which at least one of its parameter is a call-back function or a reference to Function.
- 'where' is a list higher-order-function acts as the filter() method as it returns a tuple(iterable) of the elements follow the return condition.
- iterables are dataStructures can be iterated upon using loops (eg. String, List, Set, Map). can be decalred as a standalone data structure type.
- in dart, the arrow function must have a single expression sentence after the arrow. so when multiple lines required use block function instead.

                                    OOP
- abstract class acts as an interface prevents creating direct objects from it but from the classes inherit from it.
- when a class inherit from an abstract class it must implement each abstract method [method with no implementation (execution body)] inside it.
- the class that have at least one abstract method must be abstract class.
- despite dart doesn't support multi-inheritance, Interface support it using the keyword 'implements' instead of 'extends', but require overriding each attribute and method from the super classes(either abstract or implemented methods).
- interfaces provide a contract of required methods that must be implemented, while mixins separate reusable behavior that can be reused by multiple classes using 'with' keyword. Both enable multiple inheritance.
- every data type in dart (built-in (e.g int, double, num,...) or user-defined(classes)) considered as objects.
- int declared variable has built-in attributes and methods like gcd() that return the greatest common divisor between the caller int object and the passed argument.
- any user-defined class by default extends another class called 'Object' containing some properties (runtimeType, hashCode, noSuchMethod(), toString()).
- generic classes allow you to create a class that can work with any data type for its attributes without specifying the data type until runtime.
- we can make external package of reusable variables and methods then import it in another module when they're needed.

                            additional concepts
- Platform is a class declared in dart.io used to check the adaptness of the dart script to different platforms.
- lexical closure (غلق معجمى) is declaring function inside another where this nested function can access variables from the outside surroundings 
  and have memory effect(closure) that it remember them and still can change them even if the outer function ended.

                                packages
- create dart application: 'dart create app-name'. 
- search in web about 'pub.dev'-> search about the desired package-> see readme and how to install-> in pubspec.yaml file(sensitive to indentation) add the packages to use under dependencies with its latest version manually then click download sign in top right or ctrl+s.
  or: install 'pubspec assist' extension-> open command palette (ctrl+shift+p)-> search about pubspec assist-> enter the packages name separated by commas to add automatically.
  or: in command palette search about 'add dependencies' (we find that dart itself provide this functionality)-> add package name.

- dart has functionality to fix syntax errors (with yellow(or blue) zigzag underline): inside specific dart file-> command palette-> search for '>fix all'

                                 API
- API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and endpoints that allow a client program to communicate with a server. The data exchanged between them is usually formatted in JSON or XML.
